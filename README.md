snp-compression
==============================

This project seeks to compress snp's using deep neural networks.

## Plan of actual
- [ ] **RUNNING** Tranpose and save chromosome 1-22 to the processed datafolder
    - Take the time for each of these to show to Doug
- [ ] Benchmark the best way to sample from the matrix (shuffle buffer simply sampling)
    - Try sampling first split the list into batches shuffles
    - **WAITING FOR TEST**: Just run though an entire CHROM and record the start time and how long it took. 
- [ ] Train a model to compress chromosome 22 (shortest chromosome)
- [ ] Train a model to compress chromosome 6 (include the highly correlated region MHC)
